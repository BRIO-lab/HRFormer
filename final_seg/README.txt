For next time:
- looking at the json file to see what values get passed into the configer
- trying to get the configer to work with our stuff (passing in different values)
- figuring out which of the batch norm files we want to include with our network
- combing through the argument parser from main to see what the different varaibles are that we should hard code into the network
- Editing the final network to accept different form of configuration (from old way of doing things - maybe hard code new config data)
- port over old configuration file system to work with the new stuff
